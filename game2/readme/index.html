		<p>Wheel of Fortune is a HTML5 Gambling Game. Enjoy this stylish Wheel of Fortune bonus game!<br>
			The ZIP package contains the game with 1920x1080 resolution that scales proportionally to fit the whole screen device<br>
			Just warning that for very wide screens, the game may not be perfectly full screen.
			The game is fully compatible with all most common mobile devices.<br>
			Sounds are enabled for mobile but we can't grant full audio compatibility on all mobile devices due to some well-know issue between some mobile-browser and HTML5.
			So if you want to avoid sound loading, please read <a href="#disable_sound">Disable Sound</a> section). <br>
			<strong>WARNING:</strong> Sounds can't be enabled for Windows Phone as this kind of device have unsolved issues with 'audio' and 'video' tag.

				<li><strong>Game Embedding: </strong>The proper way to embed the game is in a full-screen web page or in an iframe.<br>
                                        In the first case the game will fit the screen size, in the second, that of the iframe.<br>
                                        If the iframe size matches that of the screen, the game will fit accordingly.<br> 
                                        The alignment will be proportioned to the aspect ratio of the game.<br>
                                        To install the game in a WordPress website, we suggest to use our plugin <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/ctl-arcade-wordpress-plugin/13856421?ref=codethislab"> CTL Arcade </a>. <br><br>
				
				<li><strong>Save Score:</strong> You can call your php function that saves user credit and current win in this function in <strong>index.html</strong> file:
					<pre class="brush: js">
						$(document).ready(function(){

							$(oMain).on("save_score", function(evt,iScore) {
									//alert("iScore: "+iScore+" WIN: "+iWin);	 
							});
						});
					</pre>
				</li>
				<li> <strong>Localization:</strong> You can easily change game text for different languages, changing string in <strong>CLang.js</strong></li>
				
				<pre class="brush: js">

		<p>The game use two CSS files. The first one is a generic reset file. Many browser interpret the default behavior of html elements differently. By using a general reset CSS file, we can work round this. 
		Keep in mind, that these values might be overridden somewhere else in the file.</p> 

		<p>The second file contains all of the specific stylings for the canvas and some hack to be fully compatible with all most popular mobile devices</p>

			<li>jQuery is a Javascript library that greatly reduces the amount of code that you must write.</li>
			<li>The game have the following js files:
	
			<ul>

				<li>ctl_utils: this file manages the canvas resize and its centering</li>
				<li>sprite_lib: this class loads all images declared in the main class</li>

		<p>Resuming, the complete game flow is the following: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>The index.html file calls the CMain.js file after ready event is called</li>
			<li>The main class calls CPreloader.js to init preloader text and start sprite loading</li>
			<li>When all sprites contained in "/sprites" and "/sounds" folder are loaded, the main class removes the preloader and calls the CMenu.js file that shows the main menu</li>
			<li>If the user click the Play button in main menu, the CGame.js class is called and the help panel is shown</li>
			<li>When the user click the Help Panel, the game starts</li>
			<li>When player run out of money, the game calls the Game Over Panel and game restarts</li>	
			<li>If the user click on the exit button in the up-right corner, the game returns to the menu screen</li>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>_init()</strong> <br>
				This function attach on the canvas some game sprites like background (oBg), GUI and the wheel.
			</li>
			<li><strong>_initProbability()</strong> <br>

			<li><strong>spinWheel</strong> <br>
				This function is called when the spin button is clicked.
			</li>
			<li><strong>releaseWheel()</strong> <br>
				This function is called when the wheel stops and the game must assign the prize.

		<h3 id="htmlStructure"><strong>H) Change Graphic</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
			You can easily change all the game graphic, replacing all the file you need in the "/sprites" folder. Just respect file format (.png or .jpg) and size if you don't want to change any code line.<br>
		</p>
		
		<h3 id="disable_sound"><strong>I) Disable Sounds</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>If you want to disable all the sounds for mobile devices, you have to change the following value in settings.js file:</p>
			<pre class="brush: js">var DISABLE_SOUND_MOBILE = true;</pre>
		
		<h3 id="win_occurence"><strong>J) Win Occurence</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>You can change default win occurrences for each prize on the wheel. Each prize is rappresented by two values:</p>
		<pre class="brush: js">{prize:20,win_occurence:6}</pre><br>
		
		WHERE 'prize' label stand for money amount that player can win, while 'win_occurence' stand for percentage. So in the example above you have 6% to get 20$.
		
		BE CAREFUL! The sum of all win occurences MUST BE 100 or the game won't play!  <br>
